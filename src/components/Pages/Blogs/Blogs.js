                Javascript is a Scripting language. Javascript is a high-level
                programming language that uses the concept of Oops but it is
                based on prototype inheritance. Javascript is a programming
                language that is used for writing scripts on the website. we can
                run javascript only in browser.

                Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
                engine. So we can say NodeJS is a Javascript runtime
                environment. where It is mostly used on the server-side. It is
                used in server-side development.

                MonogDB is a database system which gives us a chance to
                efficiently store documents in a database and to perform
                operations like data updates, or to search documents by some
                criterias. MongoDB offers an API library that runs within a
                Nodejs application to give you programmatic access to MongoDB so
                you can create databases and then add, query, update or delete
                data from the MongoDB database.

                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share
                security information between two parties. JWT allows us to
                decode, verify and generate JWT.a client and a server. Each JWT
                contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. Token
                is a string of data that represents something else, such as an
                identity. In the case of authentication, a non-JWT based token
                is a string of characters that allow the receiver to validate
                the senderâ€™s identity
